## Welcome to Data Science with Elixir!

Data Science is a growing and exciting field full of cutting edge capabilities like...

* Translating hand writting into computer text - [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer)
* Predicting housing prices - [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
* Creating new images based on words you provide - [Dall-e](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/)

Data Science is complex and requires skills like: Programming, Math, Stats, and Industry insight.
There are many tools in the data Science discipline out there to help you get started. How do you decide where to focus your time? Where do you start?

We beleive the answer is to start with Elixir. Elixir is an exciting state-of-the-art computer language and has a growing ecosystem of [Data Science tools](https://github.com/orgs/elixir-nx/repositories).

Our goal is to get as many people as possible excited about learning to program with Elixir and Livebook.
